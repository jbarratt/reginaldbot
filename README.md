## Reggie Dahling

I'm making ReginaldBot for myself as a way to play with a personal bot.

Things I think might be fun to add long term:

1. Journaling. /jrnl today I went to the park and it was fun. This should be plain text-ish for eash future grepping and reformatting.
	Aside, super cool idea, track the phone location and log it to this file too
2. ToDod's. /todo learn how to make bots for telegram. This should integrate nicely with my existing taskpaper lists.
3. Alerting, have it tell me my RAID array is failing.
4. Controling IOT. /sprinklers off


## Task List

* Create a basic conf file
* Start with a basic todo writer in Go
* Once that's working, get a bot token, and put that in the conf file
* Wire up the bot and find how my user id appears
* respond snarkily to other users
* implement the next feature that seems fun
